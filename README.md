# Automated-Orange-Sorting-System
This project features an automated sorting mechanism for grading oranges. Using SolidWorks for design and simulation, the system employs a conveyor belt, IR sensors for detection, and a pneumatic actuator for sorting. Controlled by an Arduino UNO, it provides an efficient solution for hands-free fruit sorting.
