# Smart Light Control System
This project aims to detect human presence using a PIR sensor and measure sunlight illuminance with an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor). Based on the readings from these sensors, an LED light is controlled by an Arduino Uno, optimizing indoor lighting based on occupancy and ambient light levels.
